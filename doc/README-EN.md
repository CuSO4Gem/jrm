With jrme, you can write, search, modify, and delete diary/notes only through the command line. Not only that, but you can also add plugins to save journals in different formats, and process them automatically.  
This project refers to the jrnl project.The jrnl project can well implement the function of writing a journal from the command line, but jrnl has several shortcomings:  
1. Requires python3.
2. Additional information of journal (such as tag, time) is not placed regularly.
3. Additional information of lacks flexibility.
